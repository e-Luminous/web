-   Help students understand their scope of application while they are currently in a process of some sort of experiment through artificial intelligence and using twitter api through scrapping latest relevant scientific technologies are popular currently.
    
-   Through our application we can reduce around 60% of lab report students had to prepare and calculate their test cases.
    
-   According to our study it can save at least 30 minutes per experiment. That means if a student performs 20 lab experiments for each subject then it can save 10 Hours or, 600 minutes on which they can focus more on their experiments and learning what, how and why these experiments are correct or wrong.
    
-   Helping students to find their experiment accuracy is another objective of our application where we will be training the server machine with a constructive data set and making it learn which experiment is good and which are not nearly correct. We hope that this feature might help students grow their interest in lab experiments.
